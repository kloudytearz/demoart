    <p class="artwork-description">
        Paul Cézanne's The Basket of Apples defies traditional perspective, with tilted objects and sculptural folds
        creating a dynamic composition that focuses on underlying structure rather than realistic representation. This
        1895 work, part of a significant exhibition, marked Cézanne's first public display in nearly two decades and
        helped solidify his reputation as a pioneer of modern art.
