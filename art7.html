    <p class="artwork-description">
        Claude Monet’s late water-lily paintings, created between 1897 and 1926, focus on his Giverny garden's pond,
        replacing his earlier diverse subjects with the timeless motif of water lilies. By his third series, Monet
        abandoned traditional perspective, creating works like Water Lilies, where the pond's surface becomes the
        primary focus, blending reflections with floating vegetation.
